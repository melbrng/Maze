# A Maze  Project
---
> This project took me about 50 hours to complete. I explored the Unity Asset store for freebies. One great takeaway from this project was learning how to incorporated 3rd party animated assets into my project and becoming more familiar with the animation controller.

> I am quite pleased with the first version I have created as I am in the process of designing what happens next when the user encounters the Troll.
